# Introduction to Time Series Econometrics (ITSE)
Repository for the course "Introduction to Time Series Econometrics".

Each chapter of the course's script has a separate R-file with the codes used in the examples of the respective chapter. The course's script is available from my personal [webpage](https://dballinari.github.io/teaching/). For an introduction to R I recommend Garrett Grolemund's online book *Hands-On Programming with R* which you can find 	[here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/index.html).

The R examples use the package `astsa`. You can install the package by running the usual R-command: 

```r
install.package("astsa")
```
